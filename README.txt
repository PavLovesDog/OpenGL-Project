TO DO:
	- check if my code is ACTUALLY running on gpu... check against provided .sln with compute shaders
		- i.e glBegincomputeShader or someshit...
	- skim through compute shader slides
	- check other online sources how to colour mandlebrot


Explanation
With my project I used an online tutorial to help set up my own OpenGl project to help me better understand the workings 
of openGL and how the shaders (vertex and Fragment) operate within the context of openGL!

Submission
1. report explaining tech for GPGPU i.e Compute shader (used via OpenGL)
	- why do we need compute shader?
	- why do we need openGL?
	- how GPU programming works vs CPU programming
	- explain what my program is
	- what will be seeing/ what expect to see
2. solution code (my mandlebrot solution),
